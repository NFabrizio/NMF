The C implementation of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization using Itakura-Saito divergence criterion.
Multiplicative update rules are used for minimizing IS divergence.

Input file: tab-delimited text with row headers and column headers.

The Mersenne twister are used for a pseudorandom number generator. C codes are taken from http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/CODES/mt19937ar.c
